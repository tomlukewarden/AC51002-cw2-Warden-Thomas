## Brief

Design and implement an application to simulate a Banking Application (give your Bank a unique
name) that manages savings accounts, current accounts (and optionally, mortgages). Your program
should include at least the following:

### Requirements  

1. Define the classes to store and manage the data for your Banking Application [X]
2. Provide a Menu to run your Banking application. [X]
3. Provide an option to register a new Customer (choose suitable data to store for each
customer).[X]
4. Provide options to open current accounts and saving accounts. [X]
5. Provide an option to show the current state of all accounts for a customer. [X]
6. Add an option to apply interest to all accounts. []
7. For each account type, provide options to enable a customer to view their account balance,
deposit cash and withdraw cash. [X]
8. Save the current state of the Bank to a text file. []
9. Load the current state of the Bank from a text file, i.e. restore the current state of the Bank. []
10. Make good use of classes and functions in your design, to minimise code duplication and
enhance the clarity and maintainability of code. []
11. Comment your program appropriately. []
12. Make your program robust to user input errors and display appropriate messages to the user. []

#### Optional

When you have completed the core requirements, please consider adding some optional extra
features (for extra marks up to a maximum of 15%). For example:

1. Add an option for a customer to open a mortgage account, with interest deducted (when
interest is applied to savings accounts) and a monthly capital repayment amount which
should be deducted from the current account. []
2. Include separate sub-Menus for Banking Admin and Customers. []
3. Any other features you think would improve your Banking simulation. []
